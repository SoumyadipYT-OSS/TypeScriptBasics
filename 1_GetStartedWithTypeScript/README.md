# Overview of TypeScript
JavaScript, one of the world's most-used programming languages, has become the official language of the web. Developers use it to write cross-platform applications that can run on any platform and in any browser.
TypeScript addresses the limitations of JavaScript, doing so without compromising the key value proposition of JavaScript: the ability to run your code anywhere and on every platform, browser, or host.


# What is TypeScript
TypeScript is an open-source language that was developed by Microsoft. It's a superset of JavaScript, which means that you can use the JavaScript skills you've already developed along with certain features that were previously unavailable to you.
